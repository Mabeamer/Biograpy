        <p>My name is Markus Beamer and I am currently enrolled in the Road To Hire program as a tech student.</p>
        <p>Born in Charleston, and raised in Charlotte, I spent most of my life surrounded by computers. I started my programming journey at a young age, watching my father code I had always thought it was neat and decided to learn what he was doing.</p>
        <p>But I then put it down to learn a little abut video editing and cinematography over the summer before I started High School.</p>
        <p>The high school I was enrolled to had an IT academy, and I took that to my advantage trying to learn anything offered. classes there were like your normal high school with a programming course thrown in and it normally ranged from learning html to building computers and languages like vb.net and SAS.</p>

          <h1> What is Road To Hire?</h1>
          <p> Road To Hire is a program that takes young motivated adults that think that college isnt for them and puts them into a 4 month long training course, the end goal of the program is to help get them started in the programming world.</p>
          <p>There are two tracks people can take, Tech and Sales. The Tech side spends a normal work day learning the fundamentals of programming and how to code in multiple languages.</p>
          <p> The Sales track spends their work day learning how to speak on the phone and the proper etiquette over the phone with customers</p>

        <strong> Road to Hire </strong>
        <p>Hi, my name is Markus Beamer and currently I am a student enrolled in the Road 2 Hire program.</p>
        <p>This program was introduced to me by a teacher when they thought that I would be a good fit for a trip to Red Ventures since he thought I was motivated and would be a good fit.</p>

          <h1> What is Road To Hire?</h1>
          <p> Road To Hire is a program that takes young motivated adults that think that college isnt for them and puts them into a 4 month long training course, the end goal of the program is to help get them started in the programming world.</p>
          <p>There are two tracks people can take, Tech and Sales. The Tech side spends a normal work day learning the fundamentals of programming and how to code in multiple languages.</p>
          <p> The Sales track spends their work day learning how to speak on the phone and the proper etiquette over the phone with customers</p>

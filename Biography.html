  <center><strong> About me </strong></center>
<p> I was born in Charleston, and raised in Charlotte I spent most of my life surrounded by computers and tech.
<p>I started my programming journey at a young age, watching my father code I picked up some stuff and found it intresting.
<p>But I put it down to learn a little abut video editing and cinematography over the summer before High School</p>
<p>The high school I got enrolled has a IT academy I took that to my advantage and tried to learn whatever they offered</p>
<p> Classes there were like your normal high school with a tech course thrown in and it normally ranged fromlearning html to building computers and languages like vb.net and SAS</p>
